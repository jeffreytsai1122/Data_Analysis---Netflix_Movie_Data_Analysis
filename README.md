# Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix’s movie data from the 1990s to explore film length trends and genre characteristics. The goal was to identify the most common movie duration during the decade and determine how many short action movies (under 90 minutes) were released in that period.

# Methodology
The analysis used Python (pandas and matplotlib) for data filtering, visualization, and computation.

# Key Findings
- The most frequent movie duration in the 1990s was approximately 100 minutes, showing the dominance of standard feature-length films.
- Only 7 action movies released in the 1990s were shorter than 90 minutes, indicating that the action genre typically followed longer storytelling formats.

# Takeaway
This project demonstrates the ability to apply data analysis and visualization to uncover insights about media trends. The findings reflect how film production in the 1990s favored traditional feature-length structures—highlighting a data-driven approach to understanding entertainment industry patterns.
